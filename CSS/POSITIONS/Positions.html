        <h2>WELCOME TO CSS POSITIONS</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="box1">
        <h2>The Position Property:</h2>
        <p>The position property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element.There are five different
            position values:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>static</li>
            <li>relative</li>
            <li>fixed</li>
            <li>absolute</li>
            <li>sticky</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="box2">
        <h2>Position: Static;</h2>
        <p>
        <p>HTML elements are positioned static by default.</p>
        <p>Static positioned elements are not affected by the top, bottom, left, and right properties.</p>
        <p>An element with position: static; is not positioned in any special way; it is always positioned according to
            the normal flow of the page:</p>
        </p>
        <div id="static">This div element has position: Static;</div>
    </div>
    <div class="box3">
        <h2>Position: Relative;</h2>
        <p>
        <p>An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal position.</p>
        <p>Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of a relatively-positioned element will cause it to be
            adjusted away from its normal position. Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the
            element.</p>
        </p>
        <div id="relative">This div element has position: relative;</div>
    </div>
    <div class="box4">
        <h2>Position: Fixed;</h2>
        <p>
        <p>An element with position: fixed; is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays in the
            same place even if the page is scrolled. The top, right, bottom, and left properties are used to position
            the element.</p>
        <p>A fixed element does not leave a gap in the page where it would normally have been located.</p>
        <p>Notice the fixed element in the lower-right corner of the page. Here is the CSS that is used:</p>
        </p>
        <div id="Fixed">position Fixed</div>
    </div>
    <div class="box5">
        <h2>Position: Absolute;</h2>
        <p>An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of
            positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed).</p>
        <p>However; if an absolute positioned element has no positioned ancestors, it uses the document body, and moves
            along with page scrolling.</p>
        <p>Notice the fixed element in the lower-right corner of the page. Here is the CSS that is used:</p>
        <div id="Absolute">position absolute</div>
    </div>
    <div class="box6">
        <h2>Position: Sticky;</h2>
        <p>An element with position: sticky; is positioned based on the user's scroll position.</p>
        <p>A sticky element toggles between relative and fixed, depending on the scroll position. It is positioned
            relative until a given offset position is met in the viewport - then it "sticks" in place (like
            position:fixed).</p>
        <p>Note: Internet Explorer does not support sticky positioning. Safari requires a -webkit- prefix (see example
            below). You must also specify at least one of top, right, bottom or left for sticky positioning to work.</p>
        <div id="Sticky">position sticky</div>
    </div>
