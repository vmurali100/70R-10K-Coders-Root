                    situated at an altitude of 300 feet on a large hillock. Yadagiri Gutta was earlier known as Vedagiri

                    This temple has five forms of Narasimha. According to the legend, Sri Yadava Maharishi son of Sri
                    Rushyashrunga Maharishi had performed great penance for Lord Narasimha Swamy. Impressed with his
                    penance, Lord Narasimha appeared before the sage and took five Avatars known as Jwala Narasimha,
                    Yogananda Narasimha, Ugra Narasimha, Gandaberunda Narasimha and Lakshmi Narasimha. They later
                    manifested themselves into finely sculpted forms that later came to be worshiped as Pancha Narasimha
                    Kshetram.

                    Vishnu. The adornment is about 3 feet by 3 feet in dimension and it is the symbol by which the
                    temple is identified by from a distance. A legend about the chakra says that many years ago, it
                    moved in the direction from which the devotees came, very much like a compass that guided them to
                    the temple.

                <h5>Bhadrachalam Overview:</h5>
                <p>At a distance of 39 km from Kothagudem, 115 km from Khammam, 178 km from Rajahmundry, 182 km from
                    Vijayawada, 352 km from Vizag and 312 km from Hyderabad, Bhadrachalam is a pilgrimage town in

                    near Hyderabad.

                    The temple for Lord Rama was built by a devotee called Kancherla Gopanna popularly known as Bhakta
                    Ramadasu in the 17th century. Gopanna was the Tasildar of Bhadrachalam and constructed the temple
                    using public donations. But the Golconda Sultans were misled and felt that Gopanna had misused the
                    government funds to build the temple. He was imprisoned in a dungeon at Golconda Fort. Lord Rama is
                    said to have miraculously appeared before the Sultan and paid the money spent by Gopanna, after
                    which he was released. Gopanna then became Bhadrachala Ramadasu and went on composing several songs
                    in Telugu in praise of Rama. Kabirdas, the famous Muslim saint and poet, was also closely associated
                    with this temple. This is another popular attraction to visit as part of Hyderabad tour packages.

                    throughout the year from different parts of Telangana and AP states. This holy river houses most of
                    the sacred shrines of the town in and around its banks. The Ushnagundam (Hot Pool) or Gundala is
                    located at a short distance from the Temple. Parnasala, 35 km north of Bhadrachalam, is believed to
                    mark the hermitage where the demon Ravana abducted Sita. Tourists can engage in activities such as
                    boating, trekking and a trip to Papikondalu.

                    The 10-day Vaikunta Ekadashi (Dec/Jan), Sri Rama Navami (Mar/Apr) and Kartika Poornima are the
                    important festivals celebrated at Bhadrachalam temple. During these days, the town attracts lakhs of
                    devotees. On Vaikunta Ekadashi day, the colorful Teppotsavam (boat festival) is a special
                    attraction. In the evening, Lord Rama and Sita idols kept on a decorated swan boat and sailed
                    through river Godavari. Spectacular fireworks are the main attraction during this festival.
