        //REFERENCE ERROR
        //LET AND CONST declarations are hoisted are u can say let and const are in temporal dead zone for timebeing
        //var variables can be accessed even before they are declared and initialized and when v try to access var variables before declariing we get output as undefined

        //SYNTAX ERROR
        //When v try to redeclare a let varaible it throws syntax error
        //syntax erro means we cannot re-declare same vaiables in the same scope again
        //it is  possible to re-declare variables using var

        // let r=6;
        // let r=9;//as the block scope variables cannot be re-declared

        //         TEMPORALDEADZONE:
        // The time between the let variable is being hoisted and till the time it gets assigned a value or gets initialized is called temporal deadzone.the let variable(variables in temporal dead zone) when tried to access before initalization then it gives refernce error

//const throws syntax error if the value is not assigned at the time of declaration it is more strict than let

// const f;
// f=100; this throws syntax error saying to initailize the variable

//TYPE ERROR means re-assigning value to a const vaiable and it throws error saying "type error" assignment to const variable

        console.log(a);
        console.log(b);

        var a = 10;
        let b = 100;
