        <p>The festival of Diwali symbolises the victory of light over darkness, knowledge over ignorance, good over evil, and right over wrong. It is an occasion of high spiritual value as it signifies the opening of our own true light which sparkles within
            us and sharing this glow with others as well. When we ignite a candle or an oil / ghee lamp, it is to open light in the physical space. Similarly, on the auspicious occasion of Deepavali when blessed candles and lamps are lite, they illuminate
            the energetic pathway to Open the Light within us. That is why for seekers of Light, Deepavali has a special significance and value as it is a once in a year opportunity. The festivity of lights reminds us of the importance of knowledge, significance
            of understanding self and knowing and seeking the good and right pathway. Deepavali is the celebration of our inner light over spiritual darkness, of knowledge over ignorance and right over wrong. On this day, the energies of Light take over
            darkness to spread love, joy, positivity and enthusiasm. Deepavali is celebrated with immense faith and enthusiasm as a time to refresh and renew all energies. On this occasion people start preparations days in advance by cleaning, renovating,
            and decorating their homes and work place with flowers, colourful glow lights and many fancy decorations to invite Light energies of wealth, prosperity and wellbeing into their lives. They also perform prayer ceremonies, light oil lamps (divas)
            and candles. Just like Christmas, it is a time people give gifts to family and friends. In addition to the abundance being observed, charity and selfless giving are practiced, in line with the theme of “it is in giving that you receive”. The
            celebrations for Deepavali usually extends over a period of five days, and the main festive night of Diwali coincides with the new moon night. The festivity starts with Dhanteras, followed by Naraka Chaturdasi or small Diwali and then Diwali
            on the third day. Thereafter is Diwali Padva or Govardhan Puja on the forth day and Bhai-Dhuj on the fifth and last day of the 5 day long celebration. Each day of the festival has its unique significance. Dhanteras is the first day of the
            festive celebrations. The word Dhanteras itself means wealth and prosperity. The day holds special significance as people choose this day to invest in gold or jewellery. New clothes and utensils for Diwali are also bought on this auspicious
            occasion. The day also pays homage to Lord Dhanwantri who is associated with Ayurveda, a form of natural therapy and various healing practices. Narak Chaturdasi or Small Diwali is the second day. This day signifies the triumph of Goddess Kali
            and Lord Krishna over the demons to free the world from fear. The festival is all about dissolving the bad and protecting others. Diwali or Deepavali is the main day of the Festival of Lights symbolic of the triumph of good over evil and light
            over darkness. On this day Mother Lakshmi is worshipped to achieve the blessings of wealth and prosperity. Diwali Padwa & Govardhan Puja fall on the fourth day. On this day, also celebrated as Vishwakarma Day, people worship their instruments,
            arms and machinery. Bhai-Dhuj, the fifth day of the Diwali is a day dedicated to family bonding.
