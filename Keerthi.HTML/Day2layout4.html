                <p>The day of 15th August in 1947 has been embossed in the golden history of India. It is the day when India got its freedom from the 200 years of British rule. It was a hard and a long high stakes struggle in which many freedom fighters
                    and great men sacrificed their lives for our beloved motherland. India commends its Independence Day on 15th August. Autonomy day helps us remember every one of the penances our political dissidents made to make India liberated from
                    British rule. On fifteenth August 1947, India was announced free from British imperialism and turned into the biggest vote-based system on the planet.
