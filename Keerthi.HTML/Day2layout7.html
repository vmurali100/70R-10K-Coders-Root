                <p>There are very few people out there who truly understand the importance of knowledge. Every educated person is not knowledgeable, but every knowledgeable person is educated. This statement may sound weird but it’s true. In today’s world,
                    almost everyone is educated still they do not have knowledge of the subject that they have studied. Besides, Knowledge is something that helps you drive a car, ride a bike, solve a puzzle, etc. Knowledge is something that prevents
                    us from making the same mistake twice. It is not something that you can buy from you have to earn it.
