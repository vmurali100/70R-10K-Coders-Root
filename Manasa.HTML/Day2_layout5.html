            <p>The Times of India (also known by its abbreviation TOI) is an Indian English-language daily newspaper and digital news media owned and managed by The Times Group. It is the third-largest newspaper in India by circulation and largest selling English-language daily in the world.[1][2][3][4][5][6] It is the oldest English-language newspaper in India, and the second-oldest Indian newspaper still in circulation, with its first edition published in 1838.[7] It is nicknamed as "The Old Lady of Bori Bunder",[8][9] and is an Indian "newspaper of record".[10][11]
                Near the beginning of the 20th century, Lord Curzon, the Viceroy of India, called TOI "the leading paper in Asia".[12][13] In 1991, the BBC ranked TOI among the world's six best newspapers.[14][15]
                It is owned and published by Bennett, Coleman & Co. Ltd. (B.C.C.L.), which is owned by the Sahu Jain family. In the Brand Trust Report India study 2019, TOI was rated as the most trusted English newspaper in India.[16] Reuters rated TOI as India's most trusted media news brand in a survey.[17][18] In recent decades, the newspaper has been criticised for establishing in the Indian news industry the practice of accepting payments from persons and entities in exchange for positive coverage.[5]</p>
