    <h2> Subhas Bose, aged 24, arrived ashore in India at Bombay on the morning of 16 July 1921 and immediately set about arranging an interview with Mahatma Gandhi.Gandhi, aged 51, was the leader of the non - cooperation movement that had taken India by storm
        the previous year and in a quarter - century would evolve to secure its independence.[ax][ay] Gandhi happened to be in Bombay and agreed to see Bose that afternoon.In Bose 's account of the meeting, written many years later, he pilloried Gandhi
        with question after question.[91] Bose thought Gandhi' s answers were vague, his goals unclear, his plan for achieving them not thought through.[91] Gandhi and Bose differed in this first meeting on the question of means - for Gandhi non - violent
        means to any end were non - negotiable; in Bose 's thought, all means were acceptable in the service of anti-colonial ends.[91] They differed on the question of ends- Bose was attracted to totalitarian models of governance, which were anathematized
        by Gandhi.[92] According to historian Gordon, "Gandhi, however, set Bose on to the leader of the Congress and Indian nationalism in Bengal, C. R. Das, and in him Bose found the leader whom he sought."[91] Das was more flexible than Gandhi, more
        sympathetic to the extremism that had attracted idealistic young men such as Bose in Bengal.[91] Das launched Bose into nationalist politics.[91] Bose would work within the ambit of the Indian National Congress politics for nearly 20 years even
        as he tried to change its course.[91] He started the newspaper Swaraj and took charge of publicity for the Bengal Provincial Congress Committee.[93] His mentor was Chittaranjan Das who was a spokesman for aggressive nationalism in Bengal.In the
        year 1923, Bose was elected the President of All India Youth Congress and also the Secretary of Bengal State Congress.He was also the editor of the newspaper "Forward", founded by Chittaranjan Das.[94] Bose worked as the CEO of the Calcutta Municipal
        Corporation for Das when the latter was elected mayor of Calcutta in 1924.[95] During the same year, when he was leading a protest march in Calcutta, he along with Maghfoor Ahmad Ajazi and other leaders were arrested and put behind bars.[96] In
        a roundup of nationalists in 1925, Bose was arrested and sent to prison in Mandalay, where he contracted tuberculosis.[97] </h2>
