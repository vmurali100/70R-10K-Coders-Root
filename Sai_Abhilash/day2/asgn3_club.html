        <div class="about">
            <p><i>Leadenham Polo Club was established at Leadenham in Lincolnshire by James Reeve who is incredibly passionate about polo and wanted to introduce the sport to more people by bringing it back to the village he was brought up in. One of our main ambitions here at Leadenham is to make polo accessible for all, and we do this by trying to keep our prices as affordable as possible whilst still maintaining the highest standards.

            We have a renowned laser leveled and irrigated polo field, which is among the best in the country. Our fantastic string of Argentinian polo ponies are of varying levels from fast and furious match ponies down to the perfect lesson horses for beginners.
            
            Our members and clients play a big role in helping to continuously shape and improve Leadenham. Whether you have played polo for years, or whether you have never picked up a mallet before - we welcome all here at Leadenham.
